Boardgame Score Assistant
=======

An Android application.

### A generalized score calculator for board games.  

Many modern board games share the notion of victory points as the scoring mechanism to determine the winner of a particular game. Often times, the rules for calculating victory points are intentionally opaque to leave some suspense while the game is ongoing. Information that goes into calculating victory points is typically hidden until the end. After a game has been finished, players tally up all of the points according to different rules. This can be a tedious process. Board Game Score assistant will calculate the score for many different games using an internal database of rules. There are many existing applications to score individual games, but this one aims to be more general. New titles can be added in an extensible way.
