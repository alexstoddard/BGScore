Boardgame Score Assistant - Android Application

** This application will be a generalized score calculator for board games.  

Many modern board games share the notion of victory points as the scoring mechanism to determine the winner of a particular game. Often times, the rules for calculating victory points are intentionally opaque to leave some suspense until the end of the game. Information that goes into calculating victory points is typically hidden until the end of the game. After a game has been finished, players tally up all of the points according to different rules. This can be a tedious process. Board Game Score assistant will calculate the score for many different games using an internal database of rules. There are many scoring applications for individual games, but this one aims to be more general. New games can be added in a trival extensible way.
